## Key features

* Stateless and easy to deploy
* Able to retrieve geo-context information of a point from several services
* Optimized for rapid information retrieval
* Currently supports WFS, WMS, ArcREST and Placename sources
* Using cache mechanism to retrieve context frequently requested information
* Three level hierarchy (service --> group --> collection) to sort services to request
* Simple API returning json data


## API
After you have working geocontext instance, you can then check the available 
API from the API documentation links (you can find it in the main page) or 
see the content and the hierarchy of context service (you can also 
find the link in the main page)

### V2
New query endpoint accepting GET keyword parameters: `/api/v2/query?`

| Keyword       | Description                        | Details                     |

| `srid`        | Coordinate reference               | *OPTIONAL* (Default 4326)   |
| `tolerance`   | Query tolerance in m               | *OPTIONAL* (Default 10m)    |
| `outformat`   | Output format (geojson / json)     | *OPTIONAL* (Default geojson)|

## Quick Installation Guide

For deployment we use [docker](http://docker.com) so you need to have docker
running on the host. GeoContext is a django app so it will help if you have
some knowledge of running a django site.

1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone git://github.com/kartoza/geocontext.git && cd /docs/
```
2. Ensure shared volume permissions are set
```bash
make permissions
```
3. Copy the `sample.env` file as `.env` and change the values inside if necessary.

4. Copy `docker-compose.override.sample.yml` as `docker-compose.override.yml` and  change 
the values inside if necessary.

5. Setup and run the web service: available on `http://localhost/`
```bash
make setup-web
```
6. If needed, create a superuser for Django admin access on `http://localhost/admin/` - 
here you can manually modify data
```bash
make superuser
```


**Loading Data**
GeoContext use a json file to populate the context service and its 
group and collection. Everything is stored in [geocontext.json](https://github.com/kartoza/geocontext/blob/develop/django_project/base/management/commands/geocontext.json).
You can load it by running this command:
```bash
make import-data
``` 
Or if you have your own json file, you can load it with:
```bash
make import-data FILE_URI=path/to/your/json/file
```
Be careful, it will replace your context service data (and its 
hierarchy) with your new one from the json file. But no worries, when your 
run this `import-data` command, it will export your context service 
data to a new json file.

You can also export your context service to json file by running:
```bash
make data-export
```

## Developers quick start with Docker and VSCode

An easy way to set up a locally development environment is with Docker and VSCode.

1. Optional: add any ENV variables needed to for uwsgi & dvweb to `/deployment/.env`
2. Use setup-dev to build the production and development containers, create superuser,
and import default services.
```bash
make setup-dev
```
3. Geocontext should now be running at localhost.
4. DB can be accessed at port 'localhost:25432', user&password='docker', database=gis
5. Attach a VSCode session by right clicking on the running geocontext_devweb container in the [VSCode remote - Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension
6. Now we can get into the running containers to run management commands, run another server at another port, debug etc.
7. In the geocontext_devweb container terminal you can run a test server for debugging as follows:
```
python manage.py runserver 8001
```
9. Pytest is used for testing. Unit & integration tests, flake8 linting, coverage and documentation can be run with:
```bash
make test-full
```
10. See README-legacy for PyCharm and SSH access to devweb container.

## Deployment

1. Config git repo/branch and dockerhub/image:tag to use for deploy in top of Makefile
2. Run make command to build and push image
```
make deploy
```
* Note the UWSGI image must be available (setup-dev / setup-web)
