## Quick Installation Guide

For deployment we use [docker](http://docker.com) so you need to have docker
running on the host. GeoContext is a django app so it will help if you have
some knowledge of running a django site.

```
git clone git://github.com/kartoza/geocontext.git
cd geocontext/deployment
cp btsync-db.env.EXAMPLE btsync-db.env
cp btsync-media.env.EXAMPLE btsync-media.env
make build
make permissions
make web
# Wait a few seconds for the DB to start before to do the next command
make migrate
make collectstatic
```


So as to create your admin account:
```
make superuser
```

**Loading Data**
GeoContext use a json file to populate the context service registry and its 
group and collection. Everything is stored in [geocontext.json](https://github.com/kartoza/geocontext/blob/develop/django_project/base/management/commands/geocontext.json).
You can load it by running this command:
```bash
make import-data
``` 
Or if you have your own json file, you can load it with:
```bash
make import-data FILE_URI=path/to/your/json/file
```
Be careful, it will replace your context service registry data (and its 
hierarchy) with your new one from the json file. But no worries, when your 
run this `import-data` command, it will export your context service registry 
data to a new json file.

You can also export your context service registry to json file by running:
```bash
make export-data
```

## API
After you have working geocontext instance, you can then check the available 
API from the API documentation links (you can find it in the main page) or 
see the content and the hierarchy of context service registry (you can also 
find the link in the main page)
